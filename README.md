## Multimedia content

We used the following multimedia contents on our site:

- **A self-made video sequence, which is optimally prepared for the web and integrated on the website (direct integration, no YouTube).**: On the `About` page there is a video, recorded with the phone of David. The video is encoded with `H264` in the container format `MPEG-4`, so it's supported by (almost) all browsers and versions.
- **A self-made logo (vector graphic)**: The logo on the top left is self-made by us: It's in the format `svg`, so it's a vector graphic.
- **Two self-made pictures, optimally prepared for the web (pixel graphics)**: The pictures on the `About` and `My Account` are taken with our phones. They are `JPG`s, so optimally for the web.
- **An image from the web that may be used for publication from a copyright perspective (proof must be provided)**: We included multiple memes on our site which we downloaded from the internet. Because memes are generally allowed to use and redistribute under the usage of "fair use" (see [here](https://www.oif.ala.org/oif/?p=16873) or [here](https://thelawtog.com/memes-violate-copyright-law/)), we are allowed to use them on our site.

## Design decisions

- **Font**: We left out specifying a custom font intentionally, because the user of his preferred web browser is most used to the default font of it and we didn't want to change this.
- **Personas**: For Simon, viewing memes without logging in is important. Because of this, we made the meme-overview page the startpage. Furthermore, the filter is placed on top because this functionality is important for him. We designed the page mobile-first, because Miriam accesses the page on her phone.
- **Colors**: Simply black text on a white background provides the most contrast and is easiest for the user to read. For the navbar, we've chosen the color `#232323` because it adds a nice contrast to the background, but not a too harsh one.
